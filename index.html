        <h1>About Lilavatibai Podar High School</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <br /><br />
        <p>Lilavatibai Podar High School, is a co-educational English medium, unaided institution founded in 1987 by late Shri Ganesh Narayan Podar. The school was named after Late Shrimati Lilavatibai Podar, daughter-in-law of our founder and mother of our patron Late Shri Ganesh Podar.
            <br />
            The School is fully owned and managed by the Anandilal and Ganesh Podar Society. The Educational Complex was founded under the inspiration of Late Shri Pitashree Anandilal Podar in 1927 as a small exclusive school, for all those who love their children and want to impart quality education.
            <br />
            The School has classes from Primary Grade 1 upto ISC Grade 12. The school is registered with the Maharashtra State Education Department and is affiliated to the CISCE Council for the Indian Certificate of Secondary Examination, New Delhi. The school strives to impart sound, liberal education aimed at the development of the total personality of child.

        <br /><br />
        <p>Lilavatibai Podar High School today, is co-writing the future with its students. Podar's rich experience and expertise of over eighty years have translated into valuable pedagogical insights and skills. Given that the twenty-first century will see the emergence of a global society, I firmly believe that co-existence between mankind and nature, as well as between diverse cultures, will be indispensable for peaceful and sustainable development anywhere. This is why we are promoting positive attitudes to provide equal opportunities, regardless of gender, race, disabiIity or social background.</p>

            <p>“THERE IS GEOMETRY IN THE HUMMING OF STRINGS, THERE IS MUSIC IN THE
                SPACING OF SPHERES”
                <br /><br />
                -PYTHAGORAS
                <br /><br />
                Human beings have been obsessed with quantifying and classifying objects ever since
                we developed the ability to think. This is because we are the only one to posses the
                curiosity and intelligence to better understand the world around us, which gave birth
                to the largest and earliest form of science-Mathematics. It is a subject upon which
                rests the governance of other subjects, effectively granting it the epithet of the Sultan
                of Sciences. It binds the sum of human knowledge like an academic Gleipnir, a mighty
                Yggdrasil connecting one world to another. It has its roots and branches entangled in
                every human discipline, despised by many, loved by few and revered by all; it has
                been like this since the dawn of civilisation.
                <br /><br />
                “THE CURIOUS TASK OF ECONOMICS IS TO DEMONSTRATE TO MEN HOW LITTLE
                THEY REALLY KNOW ABOUT WHAT THEY IMAGINE THEY CAN DESIGN.”
                FRIEDRICH VON HAYEK
                <br /><br />
                While Mathematics rules the world of academics, Economics rules the pragmatic
                world, dictating nations and states, ruthlessly destroying those who deny its power
                and showing benevolence to those who accept it, relentless in expanding its power,
                this subject has led to the demise of empire after empire, changing great regimes,
                pitting humanity against one another in a bid to survive, gain resources and grow
                powerful. It brings upon the downfall of those who seek to bind it in the cage of
                ideologies. It is eternal, immortal and remorseless.
                <br /><br />
                I have just realized how overdramatic I have made this all sound, woe upon my
                overactive imagination.
                <br /><br />

                <p>Gizmo Geeks was launched in 2006 and since then the fest has grown to include participants from over 40 AISM schools across the city. The fest, which is in its 14th edition, was initiated to commemorate the memory of our founder Shri Ganesh Podar and consists of events that blend technology with pedagogy and challenge learners to ideate, create and innovate.<br/><br/>The fest invited students to participate in three different categories like Sub Juniors - for grades 3 to 5, Juniors - for grades 6 to 8 and Seniors - for Grades 9 to 12.<br/><br/>Events like Collage Maker, Scratch the Card, Spellathon and Quizzard for the Sub Juniors gave their brain cells a major workout while creating cartoons and comic strips using digital mediums proved to be a superb mix of ingenuity and technology.<br/><br/>The Seniors explored activities related to Apps, Games and 3D printing which challenged them to think creatively and apply their digital know-how to realistic situations.<br/><br/>In addition to the thoughtfully crafted events, Lilavatibai Podar students held an exhibition of fabulous 3D charts and models that highlighted the Sustainable Development Goals laid down by the UN in unique ways. With futuristic models that envisioned a person's body being scanned to determine their nutritional deficiencies and then supplying the food they would need to overcome the same and young chefs who outlined what foods are most essential for excellent health, the Sub Juniors category was an eye opener in terms of feasible ideas and quality of process.<br/><br/>The Juniors dived into the Sustainable Development Goals with the issues of plastic in the oceans and marine debris and innovative methods to resolve the same while the seniors tackled issues of equality and gender bias through infographics, presentations and role play.<br/><br/>The fest culminated in a glittering prize distribution ceremony with the school trustee Mr Raghav Podar as the guest of honour. Mr Podar spoke to the assembled guests about the importance of learning using innovative tech tools and creating opportunities for heuristic learning.<br/><br/>Kudos to Lilavatibai Podar for a seamless integration of technology with creative application and experiential learning!</p>

                <p>Zenith: “Zenith, at its Zenith“.<br/><br/>The 11th edition of Zenith took place on October 13th and 14th, 2018. With over 2500 students from 21 ICSE and ISC schools from across the city participating in 35 diverse events and an organising committee of 450 students, Zenith built a platform for all talents to flourish and grow. Moreover, it showcased what our generation stands for: dynamism, innovation and expression.This motto of Zenith to showcase diversity and individuality is achieved by its unique events such as Glow in the Dark Basketball, human Fooseball, FIFA , Shark Tank that is product creation and marketing, stock market simulator, murder mystery, 30 crazy tasks, stand up comedy, slam poetry, theatre events, performing arts events and more.<br/><br/>This year, Zenith was a step ahead and improved its own efficiency through procedures such as QR code registration, social media publicity on a mass scale and a Zenith Android and iOS Application for live announcements and information, one of the first feats in the city to do so.<br/><br/>More than 2000 students from 16 ICSE and ISC schools across Mumbai participated on 6th and 7th October 2017 for Podar mega cultural and sports interschool competition –ZENITH 2017. Zenith was a first of its kind festival across country to feature augmented reality in and across its events. 40 cultural events had been organized with the addition of new exciting events like ‘how to get away with murder’ (murder mystery) , ‘zenith stock exchange’ ‘glow in the dark basketball’ ‘musically’, hindi extempore , chef event , news presenting , JAM sessions along with the existing band, quiz and entrepreneur events. For the first time, personality contest was being held with 5 exciting and extensive rounds and Shann Bhatt of Bombay Scottish , Mahim and Ms. Inika Khosla were declared as Mr. zenith 2017 and Ms Zenith respectively. 20 sports events were organized at St. Andrews Bandra football turf and Bandra YMCA. Girls and boys cricket under arm tournament was organized for the first time along with the existing football and basket ball tournaments. An exclusive Instagram page for the event was set up with mannequin challenge for school to show case their preparation for the event. As podar was a non participant school, It was an excellent opportunity for more than 300 students from ICSE and ISC to actively organize and understand dynamics for each event. St. Gregorios high school , Chembur and Hiranandani foundation school , Thane were declared as the overall champions for ICSE and ISC events respectively.<br/><br/>Competitions on gaming, art, drama, you name it and we had it, with equally fueled students from over twelve ISC schools, just waiting to showcase their skills and abilities. These young artists performed spectacularly in every cultural event held in school and showcased their teamwork, ability and sportsmanship on the field.<br/><br/>To be at your Zenith, is to be at your pinnacle, your crowing point, your apex and that’s what we at Lilavaibai Podar High School wish to achieve.</p>
